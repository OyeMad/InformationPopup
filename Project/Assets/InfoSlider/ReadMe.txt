To use the asset, put the "Info Panel prefab" inside a canvas and from scripts call following messages.
- InfoPopupUtil.ShowInformation ( "YOUR MESSAGE" );
- InfoPopupUtil.ShowWarning( "YOUR MESSAGE");
- InfoPopupUtil.ShowAlert( "YOUR MESSAGE" );

These 3 types have been added as a base, if you need more designs, you are free to add more types.

To customize the popup you can create Scriptable object in project window from "Create > infoPopup > PopupType" and save that asset in your project.
Select that asset and customize it as per your needs.
You can change the panel image, color, text style, icon etc.

See the Demo Scene for more details.

If you want to see more features added to this, write back to me on asset store review.
